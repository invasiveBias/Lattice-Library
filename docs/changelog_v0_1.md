This new update comes with major changes + robust expansions to the base numerical computation modules and more excitingly a classical Machine learning package entirely built from scratch in Lattice + Base python.
For datatypes, the Integer and Float custom Datatypes had to be removed as they were adding too much complexity to the system, it's much more efficient to work with built-in data types and generally use already provided packages below and within numpy level abstraction, they (along other datatypes) may actually be reintegrated in future iterations.
The array dataype got significantly restructured and expanded, the converter function got removed (too much complexity), notably more magic methods were added for the object to be able to handle much more advanced use cases.
The computation module also got expanded with more functions being added and some previous ones updated. The main module housing the generator packages also got updated too.
Finally the Machine learning Package named 'Classical' contains modules for upto 10 popular Classical Machine laerning algorithims all built from the ground up with Lattice and some extra helper imports. All operations witihin the algorithims were done in 100% lattice without having to leak a single Numpy operation. The package also contains a metrics module for calculating Evaluation metrics.
More updates (especially a few more ML Algo packages) are coming with this version update.
