This Repo contains the code for Lattice, an Experimental Numerical computation Library i developed to get more familiar with Machine Learning below Model abstractions.
It is built on Numpy and still has a lot of computations and calculations done in pure Numpy for now. This initial version mainly contains native 32bit float, integer & 
also an array datatype,simple random Number genrators, some Linear algebra functions and an Autograd Engine(similar to Pytorch's) within the array datatype that computes the derivatives 
for common operations. Newer versions would come with more advanced number generators, more Linear algebraic and Statistical functions that natively runs calculations,
a more powerful autograd Engine and also sub-packages for Classical ML, DL & RL model instantiations natively built from scratch.
